### 👋 Hi! I’m Ishan (@Ishaannn31)

Computer scientist at heart, studying Bsc. Data Science and AI at Saarland University.

I am passionate about building **intelligent systems that perceive the world, learn from data, and make autonomous decisions to simplify and enhance human life**.  
I enjoy building software, but my primary interest lies in systems that replicate, extend, or augment human intelligence through perception, learning, and decision-making.

Focus areas include **Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, AI-driven Automation**, and **Intelligent Agent Simulation**.

- **Reinforcement Learning & Sequential Decision Making**  
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**  
- **Computer Vision & Simulation of Intelligent Agents**  
- **Robotics & Autonomous Systems**  
- **AI-driven Automation & Human-Centric Systems**  
- **Problem Solving & System Thinking**
